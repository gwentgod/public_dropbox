#### Exercise

1. Read the paragraph below. Identify three factors that may undermine the trustworthiness of
    Dr. R as a source of evidence. Explain your answer.

    President P of country Q:
    I firmly believe that wearing face masks and social distancing have no perceptible effect
    on containing the spread of COVID-19.
    I believe this because it is what I have been told by Dr. R,
    whom **I appointed** as my Chief Scientific Adviser last month.
    I always have great respect for Dr. R:not only is he **a renowned scientist**,
    his contribution to the advancement of scientific knowledge is fully vindicated
    by the fact that a number of his studies have been published in **various journals and on various websites**.

    > * Dr. R is appointed by the president, the president may just appoint someone who agress with him.
    >
    > * It's not stated what field Dr. R is a scientist in.
    >
    > * It's not stated what journals and websites are the studies published on.


2. Suppose you come across a scientific study published in a renowned academic journal.
    Upon careful examination, you are satisfied that the study itself is, all-things-considered, of a high quality.
    In spite of this, what other factor might undermine the credibility of the claim put forward by this study?

    > * Time the study was published.
    >
    > * Whether this study differ significantly from other related studies.


3. Suppose the following correlations obtain.
    Come up with two different kinds of causal explanation for each of them.

    1. Children who eat breakfast perform better at school.

        > * Children who eat breakfast wake up earlier and go to bed earlier, so their sleep quality are better.
        >
        > * Children who eat breakfast cares more about their health, and are healthier thus have better spirits.

    2. Consumption of organic food is negatively correlated with sleep disorder.

        > * People with ablity to consum organic food are better in economic conditions,
        therefore less stressed in daily life.


4. What is a double-blind experiment? What are its values?


5. Critically examine the following reasonings involving statistics.

    1. The average man has about 3 sexual partners.
        The Playboy magazine interviewed 217 of its male readers and
        their average number of sexual partners is 2.9.

        > * Sample not representative
        >
        > * Possible missreport

    2. Married Korean men like to spend their holidays with their families.
        In a survey carried out last Sunday outside the Toys R Us store at the Nuzzon mall in Seoul,
        76% of married men surveyed said that they prefer to spend their holidays with family members.

        > * Sample not representative
        >
        > * Possible missreport

    3. I have counted about 34 students skipping Professor Awful's class,
        but only 6 for Professor Funny.
        So it is probably true that Professor Funny's class is more interesting.

        > * Other reasons
        >
        > * Sample too small
